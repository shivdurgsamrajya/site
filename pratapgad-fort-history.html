<h2>Ancient Origins</h2>

<p>The origins of Pratapgad Fort can be traced back to the late 16th century. It was commissioned during the reign of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the visionary Maratha ruler who aimed to establish a stronghold in the Sahyadri mountains. The fort was strategically positioned to control the trade routes and the territories surrounding it, making it a vital component of the Maratha Empire's defense strategy.</p>
